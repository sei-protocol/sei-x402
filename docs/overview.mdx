# x402 Protocol Overview

x402 transforms any HTTP endpoint into a paid service using blockchain micropayments. Originally designed as an extension to HTTP status codes, X402 enables seamless monetization of APIs, content, and digital services.

## How x402 Works

The protocol adds payment capabilities to standard HTTP by introducing payment headers and the `402 Payment Required` status code:

    A[Client Request] --> B[Server Check]
    B --> C{Payment Required?}
    C -->|No| D[Return Content]
    C -->|Yes| E[Return 402 + Payment Info]
    E --> F[Client Creates Payment]
    F --> G[Payment to Blockchain]
    G --> H[Client Retries with Payment Header]
    H --> I[Server Verifies Payment]
    I --> J[Return Protected Content]
```
