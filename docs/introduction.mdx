## Build Paid APIs on Sei

x402 Protocol brings HTTP micropayments to the Sei Network, enabling you to monetize APIs, premium content, and digital
services with instant, low-cost payments. Whether you're building AI APIs, data feeds, or premium content platform,
x402 makes it simple to add payment gates to any HTTP endpoint.

**Works with Sei's advantages:** Sei's fast finality, low gas fees, and EVM compatibility make it perfect for micropayments. X402 leverages these features to enable seamless payment flows that complete in milliseconds.

## How x402 Works

x402 adds payment headers to HTTP requests, enabling servers to require payment before processing requests:

graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[Server Check]
    B --> C{Payment Required?}
    C -->|No| D[Return Content]
    C -->|Yes| E[Return 402 + Payment Info]
    E --> F[Client Creates Payment]
    F --> G[Payment to Blockchain]
    G --> H[Client Retries with Payment Header]
    H --> I[Server Verifies Payment]
    I --> J[Return Protected Content]
```
